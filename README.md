# Classic Github Browser Implementation

## Desktop only (for now)

Created with **create-react app**, built with **webpack**

So basically it provides you with a search form, you put a username in, the app will search for such a user on Github,
and if it finds one - it'll show you the list of his repos. You can click one of them and the app will show you the
repo's Readme if it exists. This is called FUNCTIONALITY lol =)

Things I've learned and used:

+ axios
+ react-router
+ react-markdown
+ materialize

I'll fix the visual part a bit and add new features as soon as i have some spare time!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
